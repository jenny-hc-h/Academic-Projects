# Academic-Projects
Gather all my academic projects completed during my master degree in University of California, San Diego.


## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
* Project time: Jan. 2019 - Mar. 2019
* Project description: 
Our goal is to use `Particle Filte(PF)` and `Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)` equations with a prediction step based on SE(3) kinematics from IMU data and an update step based on the stereo camera observation model to perform localization and mapping.

## Urban Scene Segmentation for Autonomous Vehicles
* Project time: Apr. 2018 - Jun. 2018
* Project description: 
Our main idea is to use `Fully Convolutional Networks(FCN)` to perform pixel-wised classification and distinguish 19 different classes in urban scene images.

## Human Pose Estimation
* Project time: Jan. 2018 - Mar. 2018
* Project description: 
Implemented a single-person pose estimation with 14 diferent joints which is formulated as a `DNN-based regression` problem

## Recursive Bayesian Tracking
* Project time: Apr. 2018 - Jun. 2018
* Project description: 
Derived the Bayesian solutions in approximation methods such as `Kalman filter` and `particle filter` on object tracking

## Comic Text Detection and Textless Style Transfer
* Project time: Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018
* Project description: 
We apply style transfer on comic images and paste back the original text, which may be distorted during transfer, on our new-styled comic image. 

## Subband Adaptive Filters
* Project time: Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018
* Project description: 
we derive the equivalence between the transform-domain and subband methods using diagonalization of the correlation matrix. By exploiting the properties of both input signal and the target system, the convergence behavior of the adaptive filter can be highly enhanced.

## Color Segmentation
* Project time: Jan. 2019 - Mar. 2019
* Project description: 
Our goal is to detect the blue barrels in an image by predicting each pixel which is belong to blue barrel or not. In this work, we basically followed the `Bayesian decision rule(BDR)`, and compute the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the class conditional densities under the Gaussian assumption.

## Clothing Fit Recommendation System
* Project time: Sep. 2018 - Dec. 2018
* Project description: 
We implement two models from both the class and some references for recommending product size fits {Small, F it, Large} to each customer.
