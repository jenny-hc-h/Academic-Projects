## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
* Project time: Jan. 2019 - Mar. 2019
* Project description: 
Our goal is to use `Particle Filte(PF)` and `Extended Kalman Filter(EKF)` equations with a prediction step based on SE(3) kinematics from IMU data and an update step based on the stereo camera observation model to perform localization and mapping.
